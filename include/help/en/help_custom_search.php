<h1>Custom search</h1>

<p>
An ticket is a generic concept, like the word "ticket", but this could be applied to a software failure (a bug), to a problem in communications, or to a problem of a client with an order. In one case it will have a serial of "customized" fields, and in another case, it will have another one. So, the possibility to define types of tickets allows this flexibility. In the same system we can work with different types of searchs.

It is possible to search all the customized fields, and save them in a customized search, when selecting the type of ticket in the search.<br><br>

<p>
<?php print_image("images/help/custom_type_search.png", false); ?>
</p>

<br><br>

Then we show the creation of custom searches:<br>

<p>
<?php print_image("images/help/example_custom_search.png", false); ?>
</p>

<br><br>

When you click on Custom Search button displays a form where you can create a search or load another.
In this example, we will save searches that are not close and belong to the group Engineering. We will select a descriptive name for this search and click Save button.
