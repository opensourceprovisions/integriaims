<h1>Erasing tasks and projects</h1>

<p>Projects pass on to be archived, storing all the information that they contain. An archived program can be deleted, leaving all its assigned WUs as “orphans” that won't be assigned to any project or task, but that will continue to exist.
</br>
</br>
To archive a project all that is needed is to press the “Archive” button on the “Project Detail” view. Automatically that project passes on to the archived projects view. Said projects will no longer automatically notify task, milestone or project closings. Said projects can be reactivated from the “Archived Projects” page. To access this view, access the menu Projects→ Archived Projects.
</br>
</br>
An archived project can be deleted, but this task must be done carefully since it <b> won't erase WorkUnits assigned to that project </b>, but it will delete the information on all related tasks for that project. “Orphaned” units remain, but they can no longer be related with a specific task or project.
