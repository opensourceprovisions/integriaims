Days since there will be autocompletion, backwards and the same number of days, the working hours in case they are not manually inserted. The inserted hours are not assigned to any taks in any project, but to <i>"Not justified"</i> hours. For example, if you set 15 days, these will be completed with the number of <i>"Working hours per day"</i> set, for all the days which work hours is below that number, for the 15 days before 15 days of the actual date.
