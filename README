== About Integria ==

Integria, originally TOPi and before of that, FRee Incident Tracking System
(FRITS) was designed as a simple Incident / Bug Tracking system, but very
oriented to be multiuser, multigroup, with several profile support, internal
messaging and internal audit capabilities. TOPI was a spin-off or partial fork
from the Pandora FMS project.

After the first pre-release version, we are added todo management, work units
and cost calculator, reporting for projects and people tasks, agenda/calendar
and full project management using a multi group/profile system.

Integria is currently under heavy development, so is not very stable for use in
production yet, but we want to launch a first stable prerelease before Q2 2008.
You could download it from our subversioncode repository at sourceforge.

Official website is at http://integria.sourceforge.net


===Enterprise Incident management===

We are very aware of company needs because we run one and have many customers
demanding a good and OpenSource Project Management / Incident Tracking system
for their needs, able to adapt to many dynamic environments. So this was the
first idea of this project: give just a professional tool that fits this kind of
needs. We want to follow some methodologies from ITIL and of course, the
experience of our userbase and customers.

Main features

* Multi user, with separated views.
* Email notification of any change on incidents.
* Incidents could be associated to a project/task.
* Incident work could be managed as work units.
* Several diferent status for an incident, and also resolution level.
* Several users can manage an incident and keep informed by the system on any
change. 

===Project management===

We are using Integria in our company to track time wasted in each project, todo
management, agenda and of course, full project management. This includes several
people working in several proyects at the same time, reporting work hours,
generating a knowledge base and setting up deadlines and task limits. Main
features

* Cost management.
* Time tracking management.
* Different roles, with different cost per role.
* Project / Task anidated hierarchy.
* Effective cost / Effective work metrics.
* Graphical reporting by project.
* Graphical reporting by user.
* Gantt graphs.
* Milestones.
* Multiuser (including from different isolated companies) could participate in a
part of a project (independent tasks).
* Independent Todo management, with optional project relationship.
* Agenda management 

===Integrated reporting===

We are using PDF and HTML realtime reporting, taken for our brother project,
Babel Enterprise and some graphic engine from the same project, and also taken
from Pandora FMS project, that uses Pear Graph modules to generate a fantastic
realtime graphs, of course, nice GANTT reporting.

== OpenSource ==

Since beggining we want to make IntegriaOpenSource, and it's licenced under GPL2
terms. All code will be free, and no portions of code or project will be under
any other licence than GPL2.

== Technology ==

Integria is a simple AMP application: PHP5, MySQL and Apache.

== About us ==

Some people who make this possible are working at ArticaST, a spanish company
focused on IT security, who also develops Pandora FMS and Babel Enterprise, two
open source projects.

== Download Integria from code repository ==

Currently we don't have any final stable release published, but you could get
code from our code repository at SF's subversion servers. We also have a first
beta of future "stable" release (named 1.0 beta 1) at sourceforge, visit our
site at http://integria.sourceforge.net.

SVN (Subversion) is a tool used by many software developers to manage changes
within their source code tree. SVN provides the means to store not only the
current version of a piece of source code, but a record of all changes (and who
made those changes) that have occurred to that source code. Use of SVN is
particularly common on projects with multiple developers, since SVN ensures
changes made by one developer are not accidentally removed when another
developer posts their changes to the source tree.

In order to access a Subversion repository, you must install a special piece of
software called a Subversion client. Subversion clients are available for most
any operating system. Information about accessing this Subversion repository may
be found in our development guidelines about "Subversion (Version Control for
Source Code)".

Subversion Access This project's t Subversion repository can be checked out
through SVN with the following instruction set:

 svn co https://integria.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/integria

== Installing Integria ==

Just decompress code on a HTTP published directory, start your MySQL and point
to ''install.php'' file to install your database and setup Integria on your
server. Default user and password for Integria are "admin/integria".

You would need a fully installation of Apache, PHP5.x, and MySQL 4.x. Have root
password of mysql at hand, you will need to create Integria database in install
process.
