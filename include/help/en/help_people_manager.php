<h1>Assigning staff resources</h1>
<p>
	As in any of Integria's options, in the Enterprise version there is a complex ACL system which allows Integria to establish a difference beteween what users can see specific items and what level of access said users have. In project management the access system is completely granular and allows users to define a “general” project manager who will be able to create tasks and distribute roles within the project. This way a “pool” of people (and roles) can be defined on every project. These people can come from different groups, and it's the project manager who will decide which roles they will have in the project. Each task can be linked to one or more additional project “sub-managers”, who at the same time can create new tasks, include new users, etc. These users must have a project manager role assigned.
	</br>
	</br>
	Individually these roles can be adjusted per task in such a way that not all participants in a project can be participating in the same tasks. Participants in a task can have permission to modify some parameters from that task (progress level, task description) or be simple users with that assigned task so that they can only view it and report work and costs for it.
	</br>
	</br>
	With a “pool” of people assigned to a project those assigned for each task are chosen from those available at a general project level.
