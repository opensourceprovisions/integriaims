	To update task information, make all the changes you deem necessart on the chart and save them by pressing the update button. If the task has more than one employee assigned to it and you wish to make any changes in this field, you must head over to the detailed editing menu and click on the icon with a wrench icon, found on the right hand column. To delete a task you can use the button with a trashcan icon found on the right hand column.

	Status coding for a task corresponds to the following completion rate percentage:
	<ul>
		<li>Pending (white): between 0% and 39%</li>
		<li>In progress (yellow): between 40% and 89%</li>
		<li>Complete (blue): between 90% and 99%</li>
		<li>Verified (green): 100%</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	To add a new task you need to fill out the fields and press the “Create” button.
	</br>

	To delete a task we must go to Task Planning and click on the right side icon of a trash can on the task we wish to delete.
