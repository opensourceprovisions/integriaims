<h1>Task List</h1>
<p>
	A project on Integria IMS is a task container with a start and finish date. At the same time, projects are grouped in 'Project Groups', for example: development projects, billable projects, internal management projects, etc.
	</br>
	</br>
	Internally a project is composed of tasks. These tasks, at the same time, can contain subtasks (so that start-to-end relationships can be built amongst them and a hierarchy can be established, which will finally be seen in a Gantt diagram).
	</br>
	</br>
	Tasks can -optionally- contain as many associated instances as WorkUnits that represent an atomic deconstruction of the task into different single-person work packages (assigned to only one user). This allows us to see at a glance the chunks into which a task can be broken up, both in planned work (WorkUnits) and in unplanned work (incidents).
