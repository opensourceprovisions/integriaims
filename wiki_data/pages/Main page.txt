!! Welcome to your wiki!

[http://openideas.info/wiki/images/thumb/b/b3/Integria_white.png/250px-Integria_white.png|right]
This is a a '''example''' wiki with some links and subpages just to show you how to use it. You probably know about [Wikipedia|http://wikipedia.org]. Thats also a WIKI and works more or less the same, but of course that one has loads of content :)

!!! What you can do on the wiki

As said, it works about the same as Wikipedia, so it should be pretty easy to use. Some of the basic functionalities are:
* Creation of '''new pages'''. You can do this by:
** Thinking of a nice page title
** Searching for this title in the menu on the left
** On the results page (nothing is found), click on 'Create page'
* Subpages (this is a [subpage|sample subpage] to demonstrate how to link different pages)
* Pages in '''multiple langues''' (see 'Syntax' menu option on the left)
* Use [side_menu] to add items to the bottom of the menu on the left
* Click 'Edit' on the left to change a page's name
* Standard '''formatting options''', like:
** headings and sub-headings (like the one just above)
** ordered and unordered lists (isn't this a great example!)
** images (you can upload and use your own images or reference from another site)
** tables and automatic tables of content
** links, bot to external pages and other wiki pages
** pieces of code (see example below)
** ... and much, much more (see 'Syntax' menu option on the left)

!!! Sample code

{{

// Check for installer presence
if (file_exists ("install.php")) {
	include "general/error_install.php";
	exit;
}

if (! is_readable ("include/config.php")) {
	include "general/error_perms.php";
	exit;
}
// Check perms for config.php
$perms = fileperms ('include/config.php');

}}

!! Now it's your turn
Now you've seen some of the options to create a nice wiki to share information between people in your organisation.

Let's build this space!
